This is the Otago OnDemand Dashboard. We're going to use this environment to open RStudio which gives us an environment to run through some examples of a bioinformatics workflow. RStudio provides access to R - a commonly used statisical programming language, and it also provides an interface to a commandline environment __Terminal__

1. Select the __RStudio Server__ app

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ondemand.png")
```

2. Modify the "Number of Hours" to be **3**
  - Click Launch

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/start_rstudio.png")
```

3. Once the box turns green and "Running", select "Connect to RStudio Server"

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/open_rstudio.png")
```

4. You are now ready to begin the workshop

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio_default.png")
